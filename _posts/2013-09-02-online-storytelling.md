  "Can you believe this is the web?"

We typically find stories on the web in the form of blog posts, video, or a series of comments. That's fine, but where the web really shines is in interactive, mixed-media storytelling. Here are some examples I've seen recently:

* [Snowfall][1]
* [The Jockey][2]
* [What goes in and out of Hydraulic Fracturing][3]
* [America: Elect! The action-packed journey to US election day in graphic novel form][4]

People are advertising, teaching, breaking stories, and advancing their agendas in new ways, unique to the web, right before our eyes. Exciting times.
