You should **[email me](mailto:bbraun7@gmail.com)**.

Seriously. I want to hear from you. I like meeting new people doing cool things... especially if we have common interests (and if you like what I'm [writing](/archives) or [tweeting](https://twitter.com/BryanEBraun) about, then we probably do).

Consider this an open invitation to get in touch, anytime.
