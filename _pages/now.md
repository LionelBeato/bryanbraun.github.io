I'm at home in Dayton Ohio. It's getting warmer every day. ðŸŒ¤

## At Work

I'm working at [Sparkbox](https://seesparkbox.com/), building web applications. I do a little bit of everything but I'm currently spending most of my time working on a web platform for a major University.

I used to bike to the office but I'm working from home a LOT these days (I damaged the back wheel of my bike, and then the COVID-19 thing happened). Working from home is nice. I enjoy eating lunch with my wife and kids.

My evenings are usually spent working on side projects like [Gridmaster](https://gridmaster.io) and [Powerpoint Karaoke](https://www.powerpointkaraoke.com).

## At Home

I haven't read a lot of audiobooks lately but I still enjoy the occasional podcast. Evenings I do [daily demos](/2019/07/16/daily-demos-a-ritual-for-raising-kids-that-create/) with my kids. Saturdays I do a lot of reluctant home maintenance. Sundays I spend all day with my family.
