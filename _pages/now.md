I'm at home in Dayton Ohio. It's nice outside. ðŸŒ¤

## At Work

I'm working at [Sparkbox](https://seesparkbox.com/), building web applications. I do a little bit of everything but I'm currently spending most of my time working in Javsacript and ReactJS on a massive ecommerce website.

My evenings are usually spent working on side projects like [Gridmaster](https://gridmaster.io) and [Powerpoint Karaoke](https://www.powerpointkaraoke.com).

## At Home

I commute 14 miles each day by bicycle and I recently started listening to audiobooks during my ride. I'm doing a lot of non-fiction these days with some occasional science-fiction mixed in.

I'm serving as an Assistant Scoutmaster and I work with the 12-13 year old boys at church. Sundays I spend all day with my family.
