This book seemed to be polarizing so I wanted to read it and see why. The best way I could describe it is one guy shares his personal philosophies about life in a format that is structured like self-help but delivered like a sermon. He talks a lot about the human condition and makes a ton of references to classic literature, influential psychologists, political movements, and Christian theology. He's very direct, which kept me engaged, but I'm sure it could be off-putting to some. I enjoyed thinking about his idea that chaos is the default and that it's much less remarkable than order is. This was a paradigm-shift for me. He uses this idea as a foundation to explain why life can be so challenging and how difficult it is to get your life, family, and mental health in order. It also provides a foundation for gratitude, which I appreciated. You can take or leave his opinions on hot-button social topics, which is undoubtedly where the polarization comes from. The book was a bit long and indulgent but presented some thoughtful perspectives nonetheless.
