I listened to the abridged version which was short and sweet. The main idea is that good non-fiction writing needs to be simple and easy to understand, no matter who the audience is. The author encourages you to dump the passive voice, avoid cliches, get rid of most adverbs, embrace quotes, and choose simple Anglo-Saxon nouns over longer Latin nouns (like those ending in -ion). Lots of great advice here!
