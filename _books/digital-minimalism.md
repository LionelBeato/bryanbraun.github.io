In this book, Cal Newport discusses how digital apps and devices rob us of our attention, making us scattered, anxious, and ineffective in our work and our lives. In response, he a proposes a philosophy for helping us take back control: Digital Minimalism. You could summarize this philosophy as "selectively adopting only those specific forms of digital media that directly support your values." He's not prescriptive about how to do this. He shares tons of approaches people have taken, from tweaking their notification settings, to completely downgrading to a "dumb-phone." I enjoyed his sections on the usefulness of solitude for working through problems, and the idea of optimizing for conversations over surface-level messaging.
