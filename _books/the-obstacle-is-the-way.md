In this book, Ryan Holiday draws on the principles of Stoicism to share an approach to dealing with obstacles, be they physical, mental, or emotional. Instead of learning to patiently bear our obstacles, he shows how we can flip our perspective and see them as our *advantages*â€”secret weapons we can leverage to accomplish our goals. And this isn't just pitching positivity. He digs up dozens of examples where historical figures used their obstacles to achieve goals they otherwise wouldn't have been able to accomplish. This book impacted me greatly because I read it just as I was facing an obstacle of my own, and it helped me see the opportunities I was overlooking. I had put it in practice and seen the results even before I finished the book! If that wasn't enough, the book is short, structured, and easily digestible. I loved every minute of it.
