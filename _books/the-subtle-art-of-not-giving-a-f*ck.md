There was a lot to *not* like about this book. It employs this schtick of dropping F-bombs all over the place to 1) make its self-help advice more interesting and digestible, and 2) demonstrate the author's commitment to not caring what other people think. It felt contrived and I probably would have stopped reading except a couple of his ideas really made me think. For example, "choosing your problems." He explains that we often pursue goals (like wealth or relationships), to try and escape our problems. But escaping problems is impossible. Even if we reach our goals, we just exchange one set of problems for another. So instead of pursuing outcomes we expect will bring us happiness, we should identify the problems that we enjoy solving the most and design our lives around that. It's a great example of [inversion](https://fs.blog/2013/10/inversion/). Overall, the book definitely wasn't my style but it still contained some good ideas.
