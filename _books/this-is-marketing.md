So much of marketing today is noise, interruption, and force-feeding people your products. In this book, Seth Godin describes another way... one where you take a stand, tell your story, find your people, and tell everyone else, "it's not for you." It's a way to make marketing that is generous and authentic. Now, those who have read Seth's blog and other books will recognize many of the ideas here. The real value here is that Seth has pulled all his marketing wisdom together into one cohesive work. While he can still be abstract at times, this book doesn't assume you've read his other stuff. I'm thrilled to have a modern Seth Godin book on marketing that I can recommend to newer readers without reservation.
