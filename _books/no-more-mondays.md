If you hate Mondays, then you probably aren't doing what you ought to be doing with your life. And you can fix that. This is the message of "No More Mondays." The book spends a lot of time encouraging unsatisfied readers to take control of their lives and do the work that they want to do. The message is one of empowerment: don't let fear of change, or doing something different prevent you from choosing a better course for your life. It was an enjoyable read.
