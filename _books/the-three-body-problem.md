I read this because of a recommendation and because it had been translated into several languages (usually a good sign). It didn't disappoint. The book explores several ideas that I found super-interesting, like "what would life look like if it evolved in a solar system with three suns?" I wasn't too thrilled about the narrative style, which left me disoriented and occasionally bored when it delved into excessive historical background (the audiobook doesn't really seem to get started until you're two hours in). Regardless, the plot was interesting, the science was heavy, and the story was engaging enough for me to finish the book in three or four days.
