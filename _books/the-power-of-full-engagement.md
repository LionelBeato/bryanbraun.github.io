In the professional world, they talk a lot about time management but in the athletic world, people focus a lot more on managing their energy. In this book, the authors make a solid argument that focusing on energy is the best way to reach high-performance no matter what type of work you're doing. The two big ideas that stood out to me was 1) creating rituals and 2) leaving time for recovery. I confess, I've often under-valued recovery and reading this helped me see that recovery is when most of the growth happens. It's easy to devalue recovery when we don't do it because we can't see the benefits we didn't gain. I plan to be more intentional about this in the future and I have this book to thank for the new perspective.
