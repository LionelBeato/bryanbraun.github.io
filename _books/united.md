I broke my rule on avoiding political stuff to read this political biography of Cory Booker, US Senator and former mayor of Newark, New Jersey. Cory is remarkable because of the hands-on way he governs. As mayor, he personally lived in Newark's poorest high-rise apartment complexes, in an attempt to personally feel the pain points of the people he served. His active style of governing included being first on the scene when there was a shooting, running into a burning building to save his citizens, and personally responding to requests on social media, promising to get a pothole filled or a downed tree removed. This book got into many of those stories, and explained how his background and values informed his commitment to serve in this way. It also touched on some of the issues he felt most passionate about, from environmental issues to America's prison crisis. Overall, it was an inspiring and thought-provoking read.
