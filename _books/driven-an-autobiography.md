This book is an autobiography of Larry H Miller, a guy who rose from an auto parts clerk to become one of the most influential businessmen in Utah, mostly due to his insatiable drive to succeed on his own terms. As it walks through his business milestones (opening a car dealership, designing the Delta center, owning the Utah Jazz), you see his idiosyncrasies and how they impact his work and his family. The book is both an inspirational ode to diligence and a cautionary tale about obsession. It's often hard to tell the difference between the two.
