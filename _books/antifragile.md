In this book, Nassim Taleb coins a term, "Antifragile," to describe things that benefit from volatility. During extreme events, fragile things break, and robust things survive, but antifragile things thrive. Examples of antifragility are abundant in nature, like the immune response and the survival of a species (read: evolution). In light of this fact, Taleb embraces natural solutions, like free markets, minimalist shoes, gut instinct, free weights, traditions, paleo-style diets, and old books (see: the Lindy effect). Likewise, he condemns naive interventionism in its many forms, like overmedication, GMOs, the federal reserve, academic research, corn-syrup, bank bailouts, centralized governments, trans fats, globalism, elective surgeries, and tooth brushing. It soon becomes clear that Taleb's views of morality are connected to fragility, as he spares no time calling out specific industries and people (labeled "fragilistas") who produce fragility or transfer it to others. Overall, I found several ideas compelling. One interesting property of antifragile systems is that their strength depends on fragility at lower layers. For example: when an extreme weather event eliminates 80% of a species, the weak individuals (fragile) are removed from the gene pool and the species (antifragile) comes back stronger. Another interesting idea: traditional religions are a product of cultural evolution, and thus their practices are woven with features designed to make our societies less fragile. While the book has good ideas, it's also fairly long and unfocused, meandering through a variety of semi-related topics while relying heavily on terminology from Taleb's other books.
