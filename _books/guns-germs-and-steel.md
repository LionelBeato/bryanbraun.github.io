This book looks at the development of human society with the goal of explaining why some groups grew, advanced, and conquered, while others did not. The author's big claim was that all advantages can be reduced to environmental factors, and that theories ascribing advantages to superior genes are false. To show this, he takes you on a tour of the world's cultures exploring the effects of climate, continent shape, local geology, the presence of wild plants and animals, and many other factors, looking for common threads. From these foundations, he showed how small initial advantages (like agriculture, writing, and centralized governments) can compound to make some societies unstoppable. The book had this ability to ask, and then answer, all these great questions that I never knew I wanted answered, like, "Why was the exchange of nasty germs between the Americas and Europe so unequal?", "Why should microbes evolve so as to kill
us?", and "Why were most big wild mammal species never domesticated?". The parts on plant and animal domestication were particularly interesting. I loved learning about the mechanisms involved, and experiencing this paradigm shift of realizing that everything we currently eat has been transformed beyond recognition. The book's biggest flaw was it's length. It's a tome, and it can be quite academic at times, going into exhaustive detail on tribes in New Guinea, with relatively few insights to show for it. That being said, it gives you this sense that there's a unifying theory of history, which is totally worth the effort.
