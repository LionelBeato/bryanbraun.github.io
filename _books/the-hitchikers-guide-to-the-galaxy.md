I read this book as a teenager and decided to go through it again, this time, reading it aloud to my kids. Nobody reads this book for its storyline, which is fairly forgettable. They read it because of the absurdity. Adams has created a ridiculous universe, and while it's a source of great entertainment, it's also similar enough to our own universe to serve as a clever commentary on our lives. Elon Musk called this book, "The best philosophy book ever," so it was good to take a second pass through it to see what other lessons I could discover.
