This book is essentially the personal journal of Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius. In it, he gives himself advice for improving his thinking and behavior. It's pretty stream-of-consciousness but there were some common themes he kept returning to, like how to not take offense, and not becoming preoccupied with his reputation, legacy, or death (#RomanEmperorProblems). It was a difficult read but I was able to pull out a few gems I found useful. For example, he says that instead of spending our effort satisfying our desires, we should seek to eliminate them. Perhaps the thing I liked most was feeling like I took a time machine into the brain of a person who lived nearly 2000 years ago, and seeing that this person was thoughtful, intelligent, and concerned about many of the same topics people still struggle with today. You start to realize that people weren't stupid back then. Many were brilliant. And yet, the Roman Empire still fell. It goes to show the importance of robust systems over geniuses when it comes to building things that last.
