This book takes a look at human decision-making through the lens of computer science. Often, this means taking a scenario (like buying a house, scheduling an appointment, or planning a trip) identifying its parallels to computer science principles, and showing how to find an optimal solution. In other cases, it looks at computer science topics (like sorting, caching, and overfitting), and uses them as analogies for understanding the world (like how human memory "declines" with age). One of my favorite concepts came from the techniques that computer scientists use to handle unsolvable (aka intractable) problems, like solving a simpler version of the problem, or deliberately finding a speedy solution at the cost of some accuracy. I wasn't expecting this, but the book gave me a ton of useful computing-based mental models, such as exponential backoff, the Copernican Principal, mechanism design, and more. Highly recommended for those interested in computer science, or for anyone looking for new ways to understand the world.
