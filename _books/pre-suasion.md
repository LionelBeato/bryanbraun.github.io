This book argued that when you want to persuade someone, the actions you take before your "pitch" are incredibly important... perhaps even more than the pitch itself. It was a great topic to explore, but I struggled with the delivery. Lots of the examples were academic, like exposing a person to a word or concept before giving them some sort of test, and seeing how they performed (boosting their confidence improves performance). I liked his assessment of cliffhangers, and was amused to see him attempt to employ them in his writing, with mixed success. The book meandered quite a bit, revisiting ideas from the author's first book "Influence" often and taking a self-serving tangent into ethics. The book had potential, but it ended up feeling a bit disjointed and dry.
