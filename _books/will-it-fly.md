This is a sort of workbook for internet entrepreneurs on how to find and validate a business idea so you don't waste a bunch of time building something that nobody wants. In it, Pat pushes you to do the work of talking to people, gathering feedback, and selling pre-orders before you spend your effort building. The book is very prescriptive and really gets into the weeds. That's great if you are validating a business idea as you read it, but if you're just hoping to get an overview on the topic, you're eyes will glaze over from time to time (like when he's describing how to format your research spreadsheets). That being said, I'm glad I read it and I'm expecting to come back to this book the next time I'm seriously evaluating an online business idea.
