This book wasn't what I expected. Its story follows the careers of some architects in New York City, each one with their own distinctive motivations. As we follow these motivations to their inevitable conclusions, we explore the dramatic social lives of these people, complete with intrigue, manipulation, infidelity, and selfishness in various forms. The last 10 percent of the book turns political, presenting a literal "case" for the independence of man against socialism. I didn't mind the exploration of those ideas, but I didn't care for all the drama. It reminded me why I prefer non-fiction.
