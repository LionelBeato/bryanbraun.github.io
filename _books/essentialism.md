This book discusses how and why you shoud reduce your life to its essential elements. It made a strong case that simplicity wasn't just about finding zen-like inner peace... that it's also the avenue for acheiving your goals. Some of the most salient advice was around setting boundaries, getting sleep, saying no, and creating buffers that prevent you from falling into reactive mode. It was the kind of book you just want to download into your brain. Solid advice all around.
