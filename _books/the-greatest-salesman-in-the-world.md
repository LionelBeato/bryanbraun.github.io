I found this recommendation in a book-list I had written in a planner nearly 10 years ago. The book tells the fictional story of Hafid, a camel-boy in ancient Israel who wants to become a wealthy merchant. Through a series of unusual events, he acquires a set of ancient scrolls containing advice for becoming the greatest salesman in the world (the "scrolls" are included in the book, making the book one part fictional story, one part business-self-help book). The significance of the scrolls becomes clear as Hafid's story ends up interfacing with biblical events in some surprising ways. Overall, it was bit cheesy (to be expected for a fifty-year-old book called "The Greatest Salesman in the World"), but I ended up impressed by how clever and memorable the story was.
