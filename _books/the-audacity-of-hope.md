I enjoyed this book. Obama brings you along on a tour of his life from his childhood in Hawaii to his work as a community organizer. He's just as good of a writer as he is a speaker and he makes a strong case for his vision of America and American identity. Overall, the book comes across as personal, approachable, and positive.
