In this book, James Clear provides a guide on how to effectively build habits that [change you]({{site.url}}/2019/02/08/how-im-making-changes-in-2019/) into the person you want to be. His writing is approachable, practical, and wonderfully succinct. The book reinforced concepts I've long appreciated (like [environment]({{site.url}}/2016/07/27/design-your-default/) [design]({{site.url}}/2018/02/15/never-count-on-willpower/) and [compounding]({{site.url}}/2015/11/17/compounding-benefits/) [benefits]({{site.url}}/2013/07/28/get-1-percent-better-every-day/)) while introducing me to several new ideas. I particularly liked his discussion of [one-time choices that bring recurring benefits](https://jamesclear.com/how-to-automate-a-habit) and [the 2-minute rule](https://jamesclear.com/how-to-stop-procrastinating). I've [read about habits before](#the-power-of-habit) but this book exceeded all my expectations. I couldn't stop talking about it to family and friends... it's probably the best book I've read in years.
