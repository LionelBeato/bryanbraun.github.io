"Thinking Fast and Slow" was one of the more popular books on behavioral economics to come out in the past 15 years. I only really read it because it was on my list and I didn't have anything else to read. It was well-written, although long (over 500 pages), and fairly academic. I liked how it explained regression to the mean. I could have done without the detailed descriptions of all the betting experiments demonstrating minor variations of biases like loss-aversion. While not the fault of this book, I've come to realize that I'm getting bored of reading about behavioral economics, and I should probably move on to other topics.
