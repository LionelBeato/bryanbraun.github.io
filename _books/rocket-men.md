You've never heard of the story of Apollo 8. Almost nobody has. I certainly hadn't. And that's pretty remarkable, considering that many Apollo program veterans, including Neil Armstrong, considered it to be perhaps the most daring, risky, and ambitious mission of the Apollo program. This book tells the story of that mission, its astronauts, and the divided nation that it helped unite, as America won back the lead in the space race. A really fun read, especially if you're into this kind of stuff, like I currently am.
