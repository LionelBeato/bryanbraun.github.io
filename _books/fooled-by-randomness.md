This book contains the musings of a professional investor who uses unconventional strategies to succeed over the long term. His big idea is that randomness governs many (if not most) outcomes, especially in investing. The illusion of cause-and-effect is usually a result of human biases, statistical oversights, and tendencies towards pattern matching. He succeeds by exploiting human overconfidence and winning big when other investors lose big. Professional investing isn't really an interest of mine and while I liked his ideas, I struggled with his writing. Taleb comes across as condescending, obsessed with social status, and generally insufferable. I may read his other books but I wouldn't want to be roommates with the guy.
