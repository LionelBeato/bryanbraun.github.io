This short book (in the public domain -- [download it for free](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12257)) is a very readable parable about an underdog who demonstrates what it's like to be determined to succeed. It's an age-old story of how nothing is more powerful than a motivated person who is driven to keep their commitment, no matter what. If you want to be invaluable, read this book, and train yourself to be like that person. Period.
