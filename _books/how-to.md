In this book, Randall Munroe (the author of [XKCD](https://xkcd.com)) uses physics and first-principles-reasoning to answer a bunch of how-to questions. The questions range from the innocuous ("How to Throw Things") to the delightfully impractical ("How to Build a Lava Moat"). To answer each question, Randall explores them from every possible angle... especially the ridiculous angles that nobody reasonable would ever consider. For example, in exploring "How to Cross a River," Randall mentions *swimming*, but spends much more time seriously evaluating options like *jumping it with a car*, *freezing it*, *boiling it*, and *rigging up a series of kites to carry you across*. This book is the spiritual successor to [What If](https://www.amazon.com/What-Scientific-Hypothetical-Questions-International/dp/0544456866), in that it's fun for all ages and has a tendency to produce absurd scenarios. You get this sense that Randall is just following his own insatiable curiosity and we get the privilege of coming along for the ride.
