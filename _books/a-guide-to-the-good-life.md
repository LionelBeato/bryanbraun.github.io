This book is about ancient Stoicism, and the benefits of applying its principles to modern life. It's concise and well-written, but most importantly, it's a pragmatic argument for adopting a life philosophy instead of running on evolutionary autopilot (which invariably results in a lifetime of insatiable appetites). If that sounds interesting to you, then check it out.
