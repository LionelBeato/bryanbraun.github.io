When I first needed to build a backend for a web application, I leaned on [the 12 Factor app methodology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve-Factor_App_methodology) ([details here](https://12factor.net/)), as a guide. It's a set of best practices for building apps that can scale on cloud-computing infrastructure. This follow-up book reviews the original 12 factors and adds three more: Telemetry, Security, “API first”. It was all good... nothing ground-breaking, but a useful reminder nonetheless.
