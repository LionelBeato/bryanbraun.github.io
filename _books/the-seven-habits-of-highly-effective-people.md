This one has been a long time coming and, honestly, it exceeded expectations. Lots of self-improvement books focus on shortcuts, cliches, and clever life-hacks, while others uncover the difficult truths of reality and challenge you to change your character. This book was in that second category. Because of its focus on principles, the "7 Habits" can improve all aspects of life, from career to parenting. The habits are: 1) Be Proactive, 2) Begin with the End in Mind, 3) Put First Things First, 4) Think Win/Win, 5) Seek First to Understand, Then to Be Understood, 6) Synergize, and 7) Sharpen the Saw. All were great topics, but I especially liked "seek first to understand". In fact, while reading, I started noticing how the conflicts around me were all rooted in misunderstandings that would be resolved if the parties truly listened to each other. If you want to read books that shift your paradigms, you'll love it.
