In this book, Kevin Kelly explores the technological trends he expects to continue and expand in the future. Rather than predict specific inventions, he discusses high-level trends (like sharing, filtering, remixing, etc), and explores what life in this future world might look like. He describes a world where everyone is hyper-connected, content is deeply interlinked, and technology can predict your needs and provide solutions on demand. This book was written four years ago, but I can already see these trends emerging today.
