I hadn't read this since high-school but I remembered liking it and wanted to give it another pass. It's a short story about a group of farm animals who rise up against their human owners and take control of the farm. Despite the animals' utopian aspirations of equality and common rule, some animals claim positions of influence and things start to go south. It's a cautionary tale of the corrupting influence of power (with obvious applications to human society). In reading, I was struck by how gradually their society transformed... how each small step away from their utopian vision seemed fairly reasonable until suddenly you realize they're sliding uncontrollably down the slippery slope. I was also forced to reflect on the Boxer's motto "I will work harder." As someone who values work, it made me see the perils of working harder inside a system with broken incentives. It's truly remarkable that Orwell could package all these lessons into a story so simple that a 8-year old could read it.
